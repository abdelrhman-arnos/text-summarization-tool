# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At our project, we take security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any potential vulnerabilities you may find.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Submit your findings to me by emailing abdelrhman.arnos.com.
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any additional relevant details.
3. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it to others.

We will make every effort to respond to your report promptly and provide updates on the progress towards resolving any identified security issues.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you practice responsible disclosure when reporting security vulnerabilities. This includes:

- Avoiding any malicious activities that could harm our systems or users.
- Providing us a reasonable amount of time to address the reported vulnerability before disclosing it to others.
- Refraining from accessing, modifying, or deleting any data without explicit permission.

We appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain the security and integrity of our project.

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have a bug bounty program in place. However, we are always open to recognizing and appreciating the efforts of security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. If you are interested in contributing to the project's security, please reach out to us.

## Security Updates

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly. If a security issue is identified and fixed, we will release an updated version as soon as possible. We encourage all users to update to the latest stable version to ensure they are protected against known vulnerabilities.

Please note that this security policy may be subject to change or update without prior notice. We recommend checking this document periodically for any modifications.
